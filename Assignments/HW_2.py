4. Using these operators (%,/,//,*), write some code to convert an amount of
time in minutes (e.g. 257 minuts) into hours and minutes (e.g. 4 hours and 17 minutes).

Hint: 
    First, get input minutes from the user using the following statement
        e.g., mins_input = int(input("Please input some minutes: ")). 
    Then, your code should convert mins_input into two variables, X and Y, 
    reprsenting hours and minutes respectively, by using operators %, /, //, *.

Print out the numbers of hours and minutes in the format of "X hours, Y minutes".

Verify your code using the following values:
- 12938 (answer: 215 hours, 38 minutes)
- 55 (answer: 0 hours, 55 minutes)
- 525,600 (answer: 8760 hours, 0 minutes )
- 432 (answer: 7 hours, 12 minutes)
