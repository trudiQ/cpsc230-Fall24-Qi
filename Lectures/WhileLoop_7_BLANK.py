0. What's wrong with this while loop and how can you fix it?
'''
#x = 1
#while x < 10:
#     print(x)


'''
1. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 10 (including).
'''






'''
2. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 100 (including) that are
divisible by BOTH 5 and 9.
Add comment for each line to explain the code
Hint: When a is divisible by b, the remainder of a/b is 0.
    Recall: How to check an even number? (it is a number that is divisible by 2).

'''
3. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 100 (including) that are
divisible by both 5 and 9.
Exit the loop when the number is greater than 50.
Use break for this question.

4. Use a while loop, print out all the numbers between 1 and 10 (including) 
EXCEPT for those which are divisiable by 3.
Use continue for this question.
